#### Hiring the right person for your team is like finding the perfect piece to complete a puzzle. Every step in the process is crucial. Here’s a story that guides you through the interview process, making it an exciting journey rather than a daunting task.

#### Preparation
Before the big day, imagine yourself as a detective gathering clues. You start by checking the candidate’s social media profiles. You learn a lot about someone from their online presence – their interests, their interactions, and sometimes even their sense of humor. Next, you can reach out to mutual connections for feedback. A friend’s recommendation can sometimes reveal more than a resume ever could.

#### Breaking the Ice
The interview starts, and it’s time for the first question: “Tell me about yourself. Who are you, what’s your expertise, and why do you do it?” This is your chance to look beyond the professional surface.
A candidate should know who they are, what their skills are, and why they do what they do. You’re looking for unique and unexpected answers, like discovering a hidden treasure. Maybe the candidate talks about an unusual hobby or a surprising journey that led them to their field.

#### Uncovering Motivation
Next, you dive into their motivation. “Why do you want to develop in this field?” you inquire. A strong candidate will give you a well-thought-out, logical answer. Maybe they talk about a childhood fascination or a personal experience that sparked their interest. This question helps you see if their passion aligns with the company’s mission.

#### Beyond the Resume
Then, you explore their interests. “What books, magazines, and sites do you read?” you ask. “Have you attended or presented at any forums, seminars, or conferences?” This part of the conversation often reveals their commitment to continuous learning. You might discover that they read industry blogs daily or attend tech conferences yearly. Their hobbies can also tell you a lot – perhaps they build robots in their spare time or are avid marathon runners.

#### Relationships Matter
You then ask about their past work experiences and relationships with colleagues. “Tell me about your past jobs and your relationships with your colleagues,” you say. Their answers give you a glimpse into their interpersonal skills. Do they speak positively about their former colleagues? Do they have stories of teamwork and collaboration? This can show how they might fit into your team.
The best answers come from candidates who think well of others. If they mention negative aspects about people but provide solid reasons, that’s also acceptable. However, if a candidate thinks that most people are incompetent, they might not be the best fit for your team.
If you’re short on time, ask a key question to gauge their relationships: “Can you suggest someone for this position?” If they respond positively and can recommend several people, it indicates they have good relationships with others.

#### The Main Question
The main question you ask is about self-improvement. “What do you feel you lack as an expert and as a person to reach your full potential?” you inquire. Follow up with, “What steps are you going to take to develop these qualities?” A great candidate will be honest about their weaknesses and have a clear plan for growth. They might mention taking courses, seeking mentors, or setting specific goals.

#### Defining the Expert
People often think that an expert knows everything and can do anything. But let’s look at it differently. An expert is someone who knows exactly what they won’t do and can explain why. An expert should have clear boundaries and a strong sense of direction. This means they have tried various tools and approaches, have experience in many areas, and know exactly what they won’t do, even for money. Ask the candidate about the things and tools they would never use or do.

#### Uncovering Risks
During the interview, you take diligent notes. You jot down risks and any unexpected or uncommon responses. These notes will be invaluable later.
After the interview, it’s important to let the dust settle. Leave it for 24 hours. Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment. This time allows you to reflect on the conversation and the candidate’s fit for the role.

#### The Best Candidate
In the end, the best candidate is someone who knows their strengths and weaknesses, thinks positively about others, and is always eager to learn. They have hobbies and interests that show they are well-rounded individuals.
By approaching the interview process as an exciting journey, you’ll not only find the best candidate but also make the experience enjoyable for both you and the interviewee. Happy hiring!
