#### Argumentation is not about making somebody think your way but about discovering the Truth.
<br><br/>

#### Goals of Argumentation
1. Help someone understand something new.
2. Encourage someone to change their mind on a topic.
3. Motivate someone to take action – the most challenging goal.

Argumentation without a goal is mere conversation. A good argument requires a clear objective; without it, your opponent is likely to prevail.

#### Beyond Words: The Power of Non-Verbal Argumentation
Argumentation is not solely about words. Your look and movements can also be powerful tools in persuading others.

For example, maintaining eye contact can convey confidence and sincerity, while open body language can make you appear more approachable and trustworthy. Similarly, nodding in agreement as the other person speaks can show that you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation.

#### The Accumulative Effect of Argumentation
Argumentation has an accumulative effect. You might need several attempts to persuade your opponent. It’s rare to succeed on the first try, but persistence can lead to agreement over time.

For example, if you’re trying to convince a colleague to adopt a new software tool, they might resist initially. However, after showing them multiple instances of how the tool can save time and improve productivity, they may eventually come around and agree with you.

#### Choosing the Right Moment
The situation must be suitable for argumentation. Persuading someone who is unwilling to engage or too busy to listen is unlikely to succeed.

For example, trying to discuss a new project proposal with your manager during a hectic meeting might not be effective. Instead, waiting for a calmer moment, such as during a one-on-one meeting or when they have more time to listen, can significantly increase your chances of a successful argument.


#### The Argumentation Formula
__Base Argument + Problematic Argument = Final Argument__

- Base Argument: The argument your companion agrees with.
- Problematic Argument: The argument your companion disagrees with.
- Final Argument: The question you pose.

__Example:__
Your opponent is a smoker and believes smoking is not harmful.

- __Base Argument:__ Health is important.
- __Problematic Argument:__ Smoking is dangerous for your health.
- __Final Argument:__ Maybe it’s better not to smoke?

#### Building Your Argumentation Strategy
Identify your opponent’s base arguments and build your strategy from their perspective. Convincing yourself first is often the most challenging part.

For example, if you’re trying to persuade a team member to adopt a new coding practice, start by understanding their current concerns or preferences. If they prioritize code readability, you can build your argument around how the new practice enhances readability and maintains consistency, thus addressing their primary concern and making your argument more compelling.

#### Context-Specific Arguments
Tailor your arguments to specific situations. Returning to our example of the smoker:

- "Imagine you found the love of your life. Would you quit smoking if they asked you to?"
- "Imagine working for a company where non-smokers earn three times more. Would you quit then?"

#### Staying on Topic
People often drift from the main topic during arguments. Keep the discussion focused and help your opponent do the same. Furthermore, assist your opponent by adding details to their arguments.

For example, if you’re discussing the benefits of implementing a new security protocol and the conversation starts veering off into unrelated issues like budget allocations, gently steer it back by saying, "Let’s focus on the security benefits for now, and we can address budget concerns later." This helps maintain a clear and productive dialogue.

#### Rules for Effective Argumentation
1. Let them speak first.
2. Listen actively.
3. Do not interrupt.
4. Stick to the main topic.
5. Ask for their personal opinion.
6. Summarize their arguments and use the formula.

__Practical Example:__
Our smoker says:
"According to a meta-analysis, current and former smokers have a 41% lower risk of Parkinson’s disease compared to never smokers. Smoking for more than 30 pack-years is associated with a 61% reduced risk."

Summarize and question:
"So, are you suggesting that smoking is actually good for health?"

#### Case Study: "12 Angry Men"
The final ["Not Guilty" scene in "12 Angry Men"](https://youtu.be/0jxVnlRdelU?list=RDQMkVx3Hpvz0rw) is a powerful example of effective argumentation. This part occurs near the end of the film, around the 90-minute mark.

[![12 Angry Men - Not Guilty (1957)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0jxVnlRdelU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0jxVnlRdelU?list=RDQMkVx3Hpvz0rw)

__Key Elements:__

- __Let them speak first:__ Tom and the other jurors allow the last holdout, Jack, to express his final concerns and reasons for believing the defendant is guilty.
- __Listen actively:__ The jurors, especially Tom, listen attentively to Jack’s arguments and emotional outbursts.
- __Do not interrupt:__ Jack is given the floor to speak without interruption, allowing him to fully voice his thoughts.
- __Stick to the main topic:__ Despite emotional tension, the focus remains on the evidence and the question of reasonable doubt.
- __Ask about their personal opinion:__ Tom and others gently probe Jack, asking him to reconsider his stance based on the evidence and his personal reasoning.

In the end, Jack, emotionally exhausted and realizing that his judgment was clouded by personal biases, reluctantly agrees with the "Not Guilty" verdict. This scene beautifully illustrates how patience, respectful listening, and logical argumentation can lead to a change of heart and consensus.

Effective argumentation is a skill that, when mastered, can lead to understanding, agreement, and action. By following these principles, software engineers and managers can improve their ability to persuade and influence others.
