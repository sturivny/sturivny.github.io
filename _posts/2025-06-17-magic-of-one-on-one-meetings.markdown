## The Magic of One-on-One Meetings ✨
<br><br/>

#### Why One-on-Ones Matter (Yes, Even If You're Busy)
Let’s be honest—most of us treat one-on-ones like calendar decorations or glorified status updates. We squeeze them in, rush through them, or skip them altogether. But done right, one-on-one meetings are powerful tools for connection, growth, and solving real problems before they explode.

They’re not just for managers—they’re for humans who work together. So, let’s talk about how to turn your one-on-ones from awkward check-ins into the most valuable meetings on your calendar.


#### What a One-on-One *Actually* Is
At its core, a one-on-one is a regular meeting between a manager and a team member. But not to talk about Jira tickets.

It’s your space to talk about:

- How you're *really* doing (mentally, emotionally, energy-wise)
- Progress and roadblocks at work
- Growth, goals, and dreams
- Career planning (not just the next quarter—your future)

Think of it as a mini campfire in the middle of the workweek where two people can speak freely and dream big.


#### Getting Started: The Setup Phase 🔧
Want to do one-on-ones right? Here’s how to begin:

- **Make it a plan, not an accident**. Block time on your calendar and protect it like a baby dragon.
- **Choose the right rhythm**: Weekly? Biweekly? Monthly? Talk with your direct reports and find what works.
- **Ask for feedback and adjust**. If someone’s not finding them useful, change things up. Meetings should work *for* people, not drain them.

#### The Anatomy of a Great One-on-One 💡
All great conversations have a rhythm. Your one-on-ones should flow like this:

1. **Pre-Start**: Come prepared. Know what you want to talk about—and invite your colleague to do the same.
2. **Start Phase**: Set the tone. Warm, welcoming, relaxed. Grab coffee if you're in person.
3. **Central Phase**:
   - Let them express
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Truly *understand*
   - Define next steps
4. **End Positively**: Always. Even if the talk was hard.

#### Stop Talking About Status! 🛑
Please, we beg you: don’t waste your one-on-ones asking, “How’s project X going?”

Status updates belong in dashboards, standups, or reports. Instead, ask:

- What are your top priorities right now?
- What’s been the highlight of your week?
- What’s draining your energy?

(Okay, yes—you can *sometimes* touch on metrics, but only if it sparks a meaningful convo.)

#### Want to Be a Great Manager? Ask for Feedback 🪞
One-on-ones are two-way streets. Take a risk—ask your teammate:

- “How am I doing as a manager?”
- “What’s one thing I could do better?”
- “If you were coaching *me*, what would you say?”

You might be surprised at what you hear. And you'll grow faster than a gremlin in a rainstorm.

#### Listen Like a Human 👂❤️
Don’t listen to respond. Listen to *understand*.

Try this instead of jumping in:

- “So what I’m hearing is…”
- “When you said [X], what did you mean?”
- “How are you feeling about that?”

Open questions lead to open people. That’s the real magic.


#### Be Transparent. Be Human.
Transparency builds trust. Here’s your cheat sheet:

- Share your reasoning
- Explain your decisions
- Ask if people need more info
- Invite questions
- Hunt for communication gaps like a treasure map

#### Balancing Brains and Hearts ⚖️
Every one-on-one should balance **practical needs** and **personal needs**.

You might solve problems or make decisions, sure. But don’t forget the human side:

- Help people feel respected
- Make sure they feel heard
- Let them know they’re supported

Because let’s face it—people are not just productivity machines. (Unless you’re in a Pixar movie.)

#### What Great Associates Do in 1-1s
Want your team to make the most of these meetings too? Share this with them:

1. Come prepared
2. Know what you need
3. Stay curious
4. Speak up!
5. Communicate clearly
6. Ask for help (constructively!)
7. Ask for feedback
8. Take feedback like a champ

#### Cancelled? Reschedule.
Life happens. If you cancel a one-on-one, *reschedule it right away*—especially if you're the manager. Otherwise, it sends the message that your people aren't a priority.

#### After the Meeting: Keep the Magic Alive 🪄
You’ve had a great conversation. Now what?

- Follow up on what you promised
- Don’t drop the ball—nothing kills trust faster
- Make clear, actionable commitments

Even one broken commitment can sour the trust you just built. Keep your word like it's sacred.

#### Wrap-Up: One-on-Ones Are a Superpower
When done well, one-on-ones build trust, surface issues early, nurture talent, and strengthen the team.

When done poorly... they’re just awkward calendar fillers.

So be intentional. Be curious. Be present.

And most importantly—talk like a human.
